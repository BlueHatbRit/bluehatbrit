# Hi there

Mostly I write code, I love doing it and I'm trying to do it as much as I can. My latest setup is working on service automation systems in the food / takeaway space  at [JustEat](https://www.just-eat.com). The rest of the time I'm hacking with Elixir to build small things that improve people's daily lives, be that their jobs, faith, or family life.

If you want to reach out you can email me (my address is floating around and not hard to find) or get me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elliotblackburn).
