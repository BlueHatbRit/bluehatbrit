# Hi there :wave:

My name is Elliot, I'm a Senior Software Engineer / Engineering Manager depending on where I'm needed. I'm currently working at [DICE](https://dice.fm) as a Senior Software Engineer. Previously I was an Engineering Manager at [Just Eat Takeaway.com](https://www.justeattakeaway.com/).

I mostly work with Elixir these days, although in the past I've also worked a lot with C# / .NET, NodeJS / JavaScript, and a bunch of cloud and distributed computing tech. I live in the United Kingdom and I work remote.

I [tweet](https://twitter.com/elliotblackburn), [blog](https://www.elliotblackburn.com), from time to time [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/bluehatbrit) about all sorts. I also spend time working with those new to the tech industry through [The Green Coder](https://www.thegreencoder.com) as well as mentoring.
